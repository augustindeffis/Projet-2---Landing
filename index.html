		    <h1>Our idea :</h1>
		    <p>Our idea and to design recycled swimsuits like that already exists. However those that already exist are I find hard to bear. I think I can combine recycling and elegance.




		    </p>
		
		    <h2>How to choose?</h2>
		    <p>Choose us because we know how to create mid-priced, eco-responsible swimsuits, made only with recycled materials, solid and elegant.

		   	<h3>Why call on us?</h3>
		   	<p>Join us because in today's context it is essential to consume recycled materials or second-hand business. And we have the strength to create pieces that don't look like they're recycled. It is also choosing a swimsuit to choose a camp, that of intelligence.
